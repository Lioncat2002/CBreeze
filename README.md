# CBreeze

A python package manager written in C++(currently WIP) <br>
(I thought about making a package manager to learning C++) <br>

It depends on the default pip package manager to install packages<br>
but makes it way more easier<br>

Just write the dependencies under `[dependencies]` along with their version<br>
in a file called `breeze.toml`
